My finger exercise answers for Introduction to Computing and Programming using Python (Guttag, 2013)

Questions answered so far:

Finger 2.1 

#Finger exercise: Write a program that examines three variables— x , y , and z —
#and prints the largest odd number among them. If none of them are odd, it
#should print a message to that effect.

Finger 2.4

#Finger exercise: Write a program that asks the user to input 10 integers, and
#then prints the largest odd number that was entered. If no odd number was
#entered, it should print a message to that effect.

Finger 3.1

#Finger exercise: Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and
#prints two integers, root and pwr , such that 0 < pwr < 6 and root**pwr is equal
#to the integer entered by the user. If no such pair of integers exists, it should
#print a message to that effect.

Finger 3.2

#Finger exercise: Let s be a string that contains a sequence of decimal numbers
#separated by commas, e.g., s = '1.23,2.4,3.123' . Write a program that prints
#the sum of the numbers in s .

Finger 3.3

#Finger exercise: What would have to be changed to make the code in Figure
#3.4 work for finding an approximation to the cube root of both negative and
#positive numbers? (Hint: think about changing low to ensure that the answer
#lies within the region being searched.)

Finger 3.4

#Finger exercise: What is the decimal equivalent of the binary number
#10011 ?

Finger 3.5

#Finger exercise: Add some code to the implementation of Newton-Raphson that
#keeps track of the number of iterations used to find the root. Use that code as
#part of a program that compares the efficiency of Newton-Raphson and bisection
#search. (You should discover that Newton-Raphson is more efficient.)

Finger 4.1

#Finger exercise: Write a function isIn that accepts two strings as arguments
#and returns True if either string occurs anywhere in the other, and False
#otherwise. Hint: you might want to use the built-in str operation in .
